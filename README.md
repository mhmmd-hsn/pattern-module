# Pattern Recognition Module

Welcome to the **Pattern Recognition Module**, a comprehensive toolkit for applying and evaluating various machine learning algorithms on any dataset. This project is designed to streamline the process of dataset cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and classification. It aims to help you identify the best methods for achieving high-performance classification on your data.

## Features

1. **Dataset Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values (NaN).
   - Explore basic dataset information such as summary statistics, column types, and data distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Standardize and normalize datasets for machine learning algorithms.
   - Calculate correlations:
     - **Linear Correlation**: Pearson correlation coefficient.
     - **Non-linear Correlation**: Mutual information scores.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Implement and compare various feature selection techniques:
     - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
     - Feature Importance (from tree-based models).
     - Forward and Backward Elimination.
     - L1 Regularization (Lasso).
     - ANOVA t-test.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - Reduce dataset dimensions and visualize relationships using:
     - Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
     - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
     - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

5. **Classification Algorithms:**
   - Test various classifiers to find the best model for your dataset:
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM).
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
     - Random Forest.
     - Decision Tree.
     - Na√Øve Bayes.

6. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using key metrics:
     - Accuracy (ACC).
     - Area Under Curve (AUC).
     - Recall.
     - F1 Score.
     - Precision.
     - And more...
